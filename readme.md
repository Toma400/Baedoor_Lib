# BaedoorLib
**BaedoorLib** is support mod for Baedoor mods ([Wastelands of Baedoor](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/wastelands-of-baedoor),
Civilisations of Baedoor and Spires of Baedoor) and serves as both library
and shared resource point.  
Despite being library-like, it can be downloaded separately and still be
used as normal mod with some features that it offers.

License of this mod is **All Rights Reserved** until further notice. It is
a bit temporary decision, just because I can't be bothered to care about
being precise. It may change soon.
