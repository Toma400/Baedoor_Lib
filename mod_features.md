#### Nether Soul Essence
Item gathered by killing entities in Nether dimension. Can be crafted into
block of Nether Soul Essence by simple 3x3 grid recipe.  
Block of Nether Soul Essence works similarly to soul soil, offering boost
with Soul Speed enchantment.

Block of Nether Soul Essence can be turned into soul soil by either smelting
it or lava source touching it.

Additionally, Block of Nether Soul Essence scares piglins, if placed, as well
as blocks vibrations, similarly to wool. Dead souls don't like noises...  
Similarly to soul sand and soul soil, you can summon wither with this block.
